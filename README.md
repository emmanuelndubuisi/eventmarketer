Welcome to the Future, where users can be able to book events on the blockchain. In the smart contract, I made it so that after an event is booked, it has an expiry time where the event expires and cannot be sold or booked any longer. In this dapp I used 2 minutes for demonstration purposes but it can be more versatile and extend to days and even weeks
